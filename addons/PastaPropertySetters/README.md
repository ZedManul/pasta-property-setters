Thanks for downloading my plugin :]

If you like the plugin, you can throw a couple dollars my way over at

It'd be greatly appreciated :)

Ever needed to set up multiple properties to specific values every once in a while,
but setting up a whole animator node just for that was kinda overkill and clumsy?
Then this plugin is for you my friend!

With a change of a value and a click of an in-inspector button,
you now can do just that!
There are a couple pre-built options to set and record nodes that I personally find useful,
but if the node you want to set/record isnt in the list of those,
you can always use the Variant setter!
Or even better, take a look at one of the addon scripts,
and build your own setter from example.
So long as it extends PastaSetterComponent, 
the apply/record buttons will appear in the editor.

Enjoy the pasta! ;)
